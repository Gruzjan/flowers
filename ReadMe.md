# Flowers
A python script that scrapes data from a city websites checking for new content and updates.

Created because the city's rules changed from fair, random selling spot assignment to a first-come, first-served basis.

## Stack
- Python :)
- BeautifulSoup for RSS xml parsing
- Apiflash UrlToImage api to make a screenshot of a webiste
- Pushbullet api for sending notifications to my phone

## Potential improvements to develop
- Instead of parsing RSS xml that is updated only every hour change to plain DOM scraping for time advantage
- Check websites' if there are any rate limits to see if checking for changes every 30 seconds would work fine
